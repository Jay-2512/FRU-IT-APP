- The FRU-IT app allows the user to take a picture of the fruit and the app will identify its ripening stage and also points out the decay in the fruit if there is any.
- For the accurate detection of the ripeness level, the system uses Deep learning. And for the decay detection, It uses Image processing using OpenCV Python.
- The webapp is developed in python and is hosted online in streamlit.
- Test our app : http://bit.ly/fruit-webapp (please note that the app is still under development and you may encounter bugs. Feel free to help us out ‚ù£Ô∏è)
